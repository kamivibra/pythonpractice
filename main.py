# This file is created for python basics to intermediate level practice only. Uncomment any section to try it out. 
# Variables
# first_name = "Muhammad Kamran"
# last_name = "Khan"
# full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
# print("Hello " + full_name)
# Integers
# Total_paid = 100
# Deducted_amount = 57
# total_balance = 100 - 57
# print("Your change is "+str(total_balance))

# Floating
# height = 250.5
# print("Your height is: "+str(height)+"cm")
# print(type(height))

# Booleans
# Human = True
# print("human")
# print(type(Human))


# Multiple Assignment = allows us to use multiple variables at the same time in one line of code.
# first we will use it separately and then we will try to use it as multiple assignment.

# name = "khan"
# age = 35
# hobby = "coding"
# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(hobby)
# Now lets try using it as multiple assignment

# name, age, hobby = "khan", 36, "coding"

# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(hobby)

# Another example, First multiple lines of code.

# Tom = 30
# Jerry = 30
# bean = 30
# scooby = 30
# print(Tom)
# print(Jerry)
# print(bean)
# print(scooby)
# Now we will perform same task using multiple assignment.

# Tom = Jerry = bean = scooby = 30  #one line of code
# print(Tom)
# print(Jerry)
# print(bean)
# print(scooby)
# some useful string methods.

# name = "kamran khan"
# print(len(name))  # if you want to know the length of a variable
# print(name.find("h"))   # if you would like to find at what number is a specific word in a variable.
# print(name.capitalize())    # to capitalize the first letter of your first word.
# print(name.upper())     # This will make your entire code of line or variable capital.
# print(name.lower())         # This will make your entire code of line or variable lowercase.
# print(name.isdigit())  #  this will check if the variable is digits or characters will give us true and false.
# print(name.isdecimal())   # to check if variable contains a decimal results True or False.
# print(name.isalpha()) # to check if variable contains alphabetic, remove the space between the name will result True.
# print(name.count("a"))  # this will check how many a's are in the variable.
# print(name.replace("k", "C"))  # this will replace k with C anywhere in variable.
# print(name * 3)  # this will multiply the variable 3 times, and will print it 3 times.

# TYPE CASTING.. converting a data type of a value to another data type.
# x = 1  # int
# y = 2.0  # Float
# z = "3"  # str

# x = float(x)    # type casted int to a float.
# z = int(z)  # type casted str to int.
# y = int(y)  # we type casted the float to int.
# print(x)
# print(y)
