# Variables
# first_name = "Muhammad Kamran"
# last_name = "Khan"
# full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
# print("Hello " + full_name)
# Integers
# Total_paid = 100
# Deducted_amount = 57
# total_balance = 100 - 57
# print("Your change is "+str(total_balance))

# Floating
# height = 250.5
# print("Your height is: "+str(height)+"cm")
# print(type(height))

# Booleans
# Human = True
# print("human")
# print(type(Human))


# Multiple Assignment = allows us to use multiple variables at the same time in one line of code.
# first we will use it separately and then we will try to use it as multiple assignment.

# name = "khan"
# age = 35
# hobby = "coding"
# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(hobby)
# Now lets try using it as multiple assignment

# name, age, hobby = "khan", 36, "coding"

# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(hobby)

# Another example, First multiple lines of code.

# Tom = 30
# Jerry = 30
# bean = 30
# scooby = 30
# print(Tom)
# print(Jerry)
# print(bean)
# print(scooby)
# Now we will perform same task using multiple assignment.

# Tom = Jerry = bean = scooby = 30  #one line of code
# print(Tom)
# print(Jerry)
# print(bean)
# print(scooby)
